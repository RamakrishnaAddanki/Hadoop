Cleanse Data Using Pig

 Notice the comma-separated values of the flightdelays files in HDFS contain historical data for airline flight delays. 

    The columns in the files match the following schema:
    Year, Month, DayofMonth, DayOfWeek, DepTime, CRSDepTime, ArrTime, CRSArrTime,
    UniqueCarrier, FlightNum, TailNum, ActualElapsedTime, CRSElapsedTime, AirTime,
    ArrDelay, DepDelay, Origin, Dest, Distance, TaxiIn, TaxiOut, Cancelled, 
    CancellationCode, Diverted, CarrierDelay, WeatherDelay, NASDelay, SecurityDelay,
    LateAircraftDelay                
                    

    Write a Pig script that satisfies all of the following criteria:
      a) Load all of the data in /user/horton/flightdelays/
      b) Remove all rows in the flightdelays data where the DepTime column equals the string "NA".
      c) The output should only contain the Year, Month, DayofMonth, DepTime, UniqueCarrier, FlightNum, ArrDelay, Origin and Dest
      d) Store the result as comma-separated records in a new directory in HDFS named /user/horton/flightdelays_clean
      e) Save the script in a file named flightdelays_clean.pig save it in the /home/horton/solutions directory on the local filesystem 
      of the clientmachine
